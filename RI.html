               <b>Short- and long-term memory processes and architecture</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of my work involves evaluating the structure and processes in visual short- and long-term memory. 
                For instance, as a graduate student I used joint modeling to evaluate how well signal detection and threshold models of visual-working memory
                generalize across different tasks. In a different project, I used state-trace analysis to examine the dimensionality 
                of visual working memory.  More recently, I worked on projects with Aaron Benjamin and colleagues that use signal detection theory to test models 
                of eyewitness memory, and examine how similarity between memory representations induces memory biases. Currently, I pursue this line of work with
                Professor Brady by developing and evaluating models of memory, primarly within a signal detection framework.

                <b>Attention and perception</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In a different line of work I used behavioral methods, psychophycics and eyetracking 
                to study some of the functions of visual attention. For instance, with Professor Irwin 
                I examined how visual attention interacts with expectation and influences error perception.
                With Professor Irwin, I also examined a basic question in visual perception, which is what factors contribute to the perception 
                of stability across eye movements. This work shaped my current interest in visual-working memory
                and modeling.

            <p>
                More recently, I examined another facet of attentional processing in a project that attempts
                to link computational models of two attentional control tasks.

                <b>Building rigorous psychological theories, with a specific focus on decision science</b>
            </p>
              
            <p> Although not my primary research area, I also have an interest in 
                fundamental issues in theory development in psychological science, which I was introduced to
                by Professor Regenwetter.  Relevant projects highlight the importance of formally modeling different sources of 
                heterogeneity, as well as other issues.  This work was also my first introduction to mathematical psychology.
                I continue to have a deep interest in using proof-based analysis in my work.
