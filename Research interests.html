                My research focuses on evaluating the structure and processes in visual short- and long-term memory. 
                Currently, I pursue this line of work with Professor Brady by developing and evaluating models of memory, primarly within a signal detection framework. 
                I have also published on several relevant topics as a graduate student.

            <p><b>Attention and perception</b></p>
            
            <p>
                In a different line of work with Professor Irwin I used behavioral methods, psychophycics and eyetracking 
                to study some of the functions of visual attention. Much of this work shaped my current interests
                in visual cognition and memory. More recently, I examined a different facet of attentional processing in a project that attempts
                to link computational models of two attentional control tasks.

                <p><b>Building rigorous psychological theories, with a specific focus on decision science</b></p>
            
              
            <p> Although not my primary research area, I also have an interest in 
                fundamental issues in theory development in decision science, which I was introduced to
                by Professor Regenwetter.   This work was also my first introduction to mathematical psychology, and
                I continue to have a deep interest in using proof-based analysis in my work.
