            <p><b>Short- and long-term memory  architecture and processes</b></p>
               
            
            <p>
                One research focus is on evaluating the structure and processes in visual short- and long-term memory. 
                Currently, I pursue this line of work with Timothy Brady by developing and evaluating models of memory, primarily within a signal detection framework. 
                I have also published on several relevant topics as a graduate student with Aaron Benjamin, David Irwin and colleagues.

            <p><b>Functions and models of attention</b></p>
            
            <p>
                In a different line of work with David Irwin, I used behavioral methods, psychophysics and eyetracking 
                to study some of the functions of visual attention. Much of this work shaped my current interests
                in visual cognition. More recently, with Mark Steyvers I examined another facet of attentional processing in a project that attempts
                to link computational models of two attentional control tasks.

                <p><b>Building rigorous psychological theories, with a specific focus on decision science</b></p>
            
              
            <p> Although not my primary research area, I have an interest in 
                fundamental issues in theory development in decision science, which I was introduced to
                by Michel Regenwetter.   This work was also my first introduction to mathematical psychology, and
                I continue to have a strong interest in using proof-based analysis in my work.
