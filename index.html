                Currently, I'm postdoc in Timothy F. Brady's lab at the University of California in San Diego. I received my PhD in Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with Aaron S. Benjamin and collaborated
                with David E. Irwin and Michel Regenwetter.

                My broad research interest involves combining behavioral work and computational modeling to study visual cognition and memory.
