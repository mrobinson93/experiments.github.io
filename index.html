                Hello, my name is <b>Maria M. Robinson</b> and I'm currently a postdoc in <A href="https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/">Timothy F. Brady's</A> lab at the University of California in San Diego.
            </p>
            <p>
                My broad research interest is in combining behavioral methods and computational modeling to study visual cognition and memory. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                I received my PhD in Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with <A href="http://labs.psychology.illinois.edu/~asbenjam/">Aaron S. Benjamin</A>  and collaborated
                with David E. Irwin as well as Michel Regenwetter. 
            </p>
