        <h1>Maria M. Robinson</h1>
            <p>Hello.  I am currently a postdoc in Timothy F. Brady's lab at the University of California in San Diego. 
                I am interested in combining behavioral work and computational modeling to study visual cognition and memory. 
                I received my PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with Aaron S. Benjamin and collaborated
                with David E. Irwin and Michel Regenwetter. 
            </p>
