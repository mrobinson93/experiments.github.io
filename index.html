        <h1>Maria M. Robinson</h1>
            <p>I am currently a postdoc in Timothy F. Brady's lab at the University of California in San Diego. 
                My broad research interest is in combining behavioral work and computational modeling to study visual cognition and memory. 
                I received my PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with Aaron S. Benjamin and collaborated
                with David E. Irwin and Michel Regenwetter.
